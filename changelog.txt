    package as Cell.
  - CellStyles was rewritten and can be found in com.flextras.spreadsheet.vos
    package as CellStyles.
  - CellEvent, CellLocation, CellRange, IPaintGridItemRenderer, PaintGrid,
    PaintGridItemRenderer, PaintGridRowResizeSkin, PGIR, Row, StylesProxy were removed

- com.flextras.spreadsheet package was rewritten:
  - except for ISpreadsheet and SpreadsheetEvent (backward compatibility and calc
    dependancies)
  
  - ISpreadsheetItemRenderer was removed
  - SpreadsheetItemEditor and SpreadsheetItemRenderer were rewritten and are now part of
    com.flextras.spreadsheet.itemRenderers.GridItemRenderer
  - new Spreadsheet has been rewritten from ground up and shares with old Spreadsheet
    very few things:
    - they both implements ISpreadsheet interface (nearly identical implementation)
    - they're both using the same calc library
    - nearly identical frontend:
      - same api for disabling cells (except for Vector.<Cell> vs Array)
      - same column width / row height apis
      - same column / row count apis
      - same column / row managment (insertion, deletion, cleanup) apis
      - similar cell, range styles apis (Point instead of CellLocation, Rectangle
        instead of CellRange)

  - ... what they don't have in common:
    - new Spreadsheet is Flex 4 only
    - everything visual is located and handled in skin parts (column / row headers,
      grid), item renderers, layouts
    - global styles are handled differently
    - everything related to cells has been moved into Cell class, where each instance
      handles different events (whether an row was inserted, in which case that
      particular instance of Cell class updates itself - if needed; etc) on its own.
